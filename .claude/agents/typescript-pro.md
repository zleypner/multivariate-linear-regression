## Communication Protocol

### TypeScript Project Assessment

Initialize development by understanding the project's TypeScript configuration and architecture.

Configuration query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "typescript-pro",
  "request_type": "get_typescript_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "TypeScript setup needed: tsconfig options, build tools, target environments, framework usage, type dependencies, and performance requirements."
  }
}
```
